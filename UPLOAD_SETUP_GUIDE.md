# 📸 Professional Profile Photo Upload Setup Guide

## Overview

This guide will help you set up the professional profile photo upload system with loading modals, progress indicators, and toast notifications.

## 🚀 Quick Setup

### 1. Install Backend Dependencies

```bash
cd backend-api
npm install multer sharp
```

### 2. Run Database Migration

Execute this SQL in your MySQL/MariaDB database:

```sql
USE library_management_system;

-- Add ProfilePhoto column to Students table
ALTER TABLE Students 
ADD COLUMN ProfilePhoto VARCHAR(500) NULL 
COMMENT 'URL or path to student profile photo' 
AFTER PhoneNumber;

-- Add index for better performance
CREATE INDEX idx_students_profile_photo ON Students(ProfilePhoto);

-- Verify the change
DESCRIBE Students;
```

### 3. Create Upload Directory

The upload directory will be created automatically when the server starts, but you can create it manually:

```bash
mkdir -p backend-api/uploads/profile-photos
```

### 4. Start the Server

```bash
cd backend-api
npm start
```
